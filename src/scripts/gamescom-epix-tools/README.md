Automatically adds all the Epix friends links from the gamescom discord server

To use:
0. Install the script

1. Join the gamescom discord server: <https://discord.gg/gamescom>
2. Go to [`epix-friendlinks`](https://discord.com/channels/574865170694799400/1259933715409145966) channel
3. Click the run button at the top of the channel (Refresh the page if the button isn't there)

**If the button still doesn't show up in Discord, try opening dev tools first, refresh, and let it run with it open**

You will need your Epix userId. This is different from the one in your invite link.
Your userId is 32 characters long and can be found by:

1. going to your [Epix profile](https://www.gamescom.global/en/epix)
2. opening dev tools
3. going to the network tab
4. refreshing the page
5. Look for requests that end with `user?userId=XXXXXX`

You **CAN** use multiple accounts. When asked, just input them with a `,` between each ID
